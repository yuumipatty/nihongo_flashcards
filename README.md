## Nihongo Flashcard ##

## Description

This project is a simple yet effective flashcard app designed to help users learn and memorize Japanese vocabulary, kanji, and grammar. The goal of this project is to create an interactive and user-friendly interface where learners can practice their Japanese in a fun and engaging way.

### Features:
- Flashcards for vocabulary, kanji, and grammar points.
- Spaced repetition algorithm to optimize learning (coming soon).

## Current Status
**This project is still under development.** While the basic flashcard functionality is working, additional features like spaced repetition, progress tracking, and category expansion are still being worked on. Please check back for updates!
